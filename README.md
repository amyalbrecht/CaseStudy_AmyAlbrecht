## Technical Issues and How I Tackled the Challenges

I’m brand new to GitHub, so I had lots of issues trying to figure it out. I’m getting the hang of it now, though.


There were several things I wanted to include in this project, but I realized that due to time constraints, they had become stretch goals:

- Comments and Likes for each Photo
- Date Created field for Photo and Album
- search for photos by Tag
- Carousel in Bootstrap
